# Claude Extension Toolkit

A meta-development toolkit for creating Claude Code extensions. This plugin provides skills for building and optimizing skills, agents, commands, plugins, and rules.

This is very much an experiment.

## Installation

```bash
# From local directory
claude plugin install ~/.claude/plugins/claude-extension-toolkit

# Or add to your settings
claude config add plugins ~/.claude/plugins/claude-extension-toolkit
```

## Skills Included

### `/claude-dev` - Extension Type Decision Helper

Entry point for Claude Code customization. Helps you decide which extension type to use:

- **Commands** - Simple slash-invoked actions
- **Skills** - Domain expertise and complex guidance
- **Agents** - Autonomous multi-step tasks
- **Rules** - CLAUDE.md, settings, and hooks
- **Plugins** - Bundled, distributable packages

### `/create-command` - Command Builder

Create slash commands with:

- Frontmatter configuration (description, arguments, allowed tools)
- File references and argument patterns
- Git workflow integration examples

### `/create-skill` - Skill Builder

Create skills with:

- SKILL.md structure and frontmatter
- Progressive disclosure via references/
- Template patterns for different skill types

### `/create-agent` - Agent Builder

Create autonomous agents with:

- Agent frontmatter (tools, model, color)
- Triggering description patterns
- Tool restriction strategies
- Model selection guidance

### `/create-plugin` - Plugin Builder

Create distributable plugins with:

- plugin.json manifest structure
- Component organization (commands, skills, agents, hooks)
- MCP server integration
- Marketplace publishing workflow

### `/create-rules` - Rules Builder

Create configuration with:

- CLAUDE.md structure (global, project, nested)
- Settings files (settings.json, settings.local.json)
- Hooks configuration (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, etc.)

### `/extension-audit` - Extension Analyzer

Analyze and optimize existing extensions:

- Token efficiency analysis
- Currency verification (outdated APIs/docs)
- Structure improvements
- Type-specific optimization strategies

## Usage Examples

```
# Decide what type of extension to build
/claude-dev

# Create a new command
/create-command

# Create a skill for a specific domain
